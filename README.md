Instagram Post implementation using React.

This is my first React project which got me into React programming.

Here are some details about the project:
a. User post that looks like Instagram post
b. Ability to write comments
c. Ability to like the post or mark it as important, or like comments
d. Mention users in the post description or the comments section
e. When the post description is long or there is a new line in it, a button appears to reveal the full description
